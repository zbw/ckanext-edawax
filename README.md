# ckanext-edawax
CKAN extension for [ZBW Journaldata Archive](http://journaldata.zbw.eu). Provides
modifications of route and link naming (organizations => journals) as well as some theming
and layout modifications. Also implements a workflow for journals.

This package has been developed for the [EDaWaX](http://http://www.edawax.de/) project at
the [ZBW](http://zbw.eu) (German National Library of Economics).


## Requirements
tested with CKAN 2.9 and Python3

**Note**:
for several reasons the workflow implementation does not work with the original CKAN.
Minor modifications are necessary to make it work. If you're interested in that you must
use the fork at https://github.com/hbunke/ckan/tree/edawax-v2.4.1/ckan


## Installation
Clone this repository into your CKAN src folder and install it the usual way `pip install
