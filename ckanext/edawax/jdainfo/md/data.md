**Your rights**<br>
You have the right to obtain, upon request, information about the personal data which are stored about you free of charge. You also have the right to demand that false data be corrected or deleted. You have the right to restrict the processing of your data, the right to object to processing, and the right to data portability.

If you have consented to our processing of your data, you can revoke this consent at any time, taking effect from the time of revocation. You also have the right to file a complaint with a data protection authority about the processing of your data by us.

**Anonymous Data Collection**<br>
You can visit the webpages of the German National Library of Economics without telling us who you are. We only get to know the name of your internet service provider, the website from which you came to our website and which of our webpages you visit. This information will be used for statistical purposes. You as an individual customer remain anonymous.

##Collection and Processing of Personal Data

If you call up pages and files on this website and are asked to enter private
data, these data will be transmitted on the internet via SSL, encrypted and
protected against unautorised access.
-->

**Utilisation and Circulation of Personal Data**<br>
The personal data collected on the webpages of the German National Library of Economics will only be used without your consent for the execution of contracts and in order to process your enquiries. Beyond this, your data will only be used with your prior consent for advertising and market research and the tailoring of electronic ZBW services to customer requirements. Equally, your data will only be used for tailoring individualised advertising if you have granted your consent. Your data will not be circulated to third parties. You can revoke your consent at any time, effective from the time of revocation.

**Transfer and Processing of Data to Countries outside the European Economic Area**<br>
We do not transfer any of these data into states outside the European Union (so-called third countries). This excludes personal data you provide in the webforms sent to Research Guide EconDesk. This data transfer takes place based on the "standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries" of the European Union. Please be aware that the level of data protection in third countries may differ from German and EU standards.

**Cookies**<br>
We save so-called session-cookies on your hard drive which are valid only during your visit on our website. These are needed to identify and authorise you after successful login in the protected sections of our website for the duration of your visit. These cookies will automatically be deleted from your hard drive after you have ended your visit.

**External Links**<br>
In order to provide you with the best possible information, we offer links to third parties’ websites on our website. Whenever it is not obvious that these are external links we will provide an explicit notice. The German National Library of Economics cannot control the contents and design of third parties’ websites. Therefore, the guarantees given by this data protection statement do not apply to those websites.

## Use of Facebook Social Plugins
Our internet presence uses social plugins (“plugins”) of the social network
Facebook.com which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo
Alto, CA 94304, USA. These plugins can be recognised by one of the Facebook
logos (white “f” on a blue tile or a “thumbs-up” sign) or are marked as
“Facebook social plugin”. As soon as a page of our internet presence which
contains such a plugin is accessed, your browser will establish a direct
connection with the servers of Facebook. The content of the plugin will be
communicated directly from Facebook to your browser and embedded in the
website. Facebook obtains the information that you have accessed the
corresponding page of our website through the embedding of the plugin. If you
are at that time logged into Facebook, Facebook will be able to allocate your
visit to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, (e.g. use the
“like” button or leave a comment) then this information will be transmitted by
your browser directly to Facebook and stored there. Please look up the Data Use
Policy of Facebook, if you wish to know more about the purpose and scope of
data collection, the further processing and use of these data by Facebook and
your corresponding rights and settings options for the safeguarding of your
privacy.
-->

**E-mails**<br>
If you send us an e-mail, we will use your e-mail address only for corresponding with you. After the end of correspondence, your e-mail address will be deleted. It will not be used for other purposes or transmitted to third parties. We also advise you that unauthorised access and falsification are possible if e-mails are transmitted without encryption.
